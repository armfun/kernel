ROCKCHIP audio complex, with MAX98090 CODEC

Required properties:
- compatible : "rockchip,rockchip-audio-max98090"
- rockchip,audio-routing : A list of the connections between audio components.
  Each entry is a pair of strings, the first being the connection's sink,
  the second being the connection's source. Valid names for sources and
  sinks are the MAX98090's pins (as documented in its binding), and the jacks
  on the board:

  * Headphones
  * Speakers
  * Mic Jack

- rockchip,i2s-controller : The phandle of the Tegra I2S controller that's
  connected to the CODEC.
- rockchip,audio-codec : The phandle of the MAX98090 audio codec.

Optional properties:
- rockchip,hp-det-gpios : The GPIO that detect headphones are plugged in
- rockchip,mic-det-gpios : The GPIO that detect micphones are plugged in

Example:

sound {
	compatible = "rockchip,rockchip-audio-max98090-veyron",
		     "rockchip,rockchip-audio-max98090";
	nvidia,model = "ROCKCHIP-I2S";

	nvidia,audio-routing =
		"Headphones", "HPR",
		"Headphones", "HPL",
		"Speakers", "SPKR",
		"Speakers", "SPKL",
		"Mic Jack", "MICBIAS",
		"IN34", "Mic Jack";

	nvidia,i2s-controller = <&i2s>;
	nvidia,audio-codec = <&max98090>;
};
