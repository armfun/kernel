Rockchip RK3288 LVDS interface
================================
Required properties:
- compatible: "rockchip,rk3288-lvds";

- reg: physical base address of the controller and length

- clocks: from common clock binding: handle to dp clock.
	of memory mapped region.
- clock-names: from common clock binding: Shall be "pclk_lvds".
	pclk_lvds: for power domain, if it disable soc will power down

- rockchip,grf: this soc should set GRF regs, so need get grf here.
- rockchip,data-mapping: should be "vesa" or "jeida"
	This describes how the color bits are laid out in the
	serialized LVDS signal.

- rockchip,data-width: should be <18> or <24>

- rockchip,display: a display node as described by
	Documentation/devicetree/bindings/video/rockchip-display.txt

- rockchip,panel: required a simple panel node as described by
	Documentation/devicetree/bindings/panel/simple-panel.txt

Example:
SOC specific portion:
	lvds: lvds@ff96c000 {
		compatible = "rockchip,rk3288-lvds";
		reg = <0xff96c000 0x4000>;
		clocks = <&cru PCLK_LVDS_PHY>;
		clock-names = "pclk_lvds";

		rockchip,grf = <&grf>;
		rockchip,data-mapping = "jeida";
		rockchip,data-width = <24>;
		rockchip,panel = <&panel>
	};
