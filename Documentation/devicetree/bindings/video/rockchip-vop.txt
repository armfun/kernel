device-tree bindings for rockchip soc display controller (vop)

VOP (Visual Output Processor) is the Display Controller for the Rockchip
series of SoCs which transfers the image data from a video memory
buffer to an external LCD interface.

Required properties:
- compatible: value should be one of the following
		"rockchip,rk3288-vopb";
		"rockchip,rk3288-vopl";

- interrupts: should contain a list of all VOP IP block interrupts in the
		 order: VSYNC, LCD_SYSTEM. The interrupt specifier
		 format depends on the interrupt controller used.

- clocks: must include clock specifiers corresponding to entries in the
		clock-names property.

- clock-names: Must contain
		aclk_vop: for ddr buffer transfer.
		hclk_vop: for ahb bus to R/W the phy regs.
		dclk_vop: pixel clock.

- rockchip,iommu: required a iommu node

Example:
SoC specific DT entry:
	vopb: vopb@ff930000 {
		compatible = "rockchip,rk3288-vopb";
		reg = <0xff930000 0x19c>;
		interrupts = <GIC_SPI 15 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
		clocks = <&cru ACLK_VOP0>, <&cru DCLK_VOP0>, <&cru HCLK_VOP0>;
		clock-names = "aclk_vop", "dclk_vop", "hclk_vop";
		rockchip,iommu = <&vopb_mmu>;
	};
