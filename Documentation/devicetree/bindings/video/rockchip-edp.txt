Rockchip RK3288 EDP interface
================================

Required properties:
- compatible: "rockchip,rk3288-edp";

- reg: physical base address of the controller and length
- clocks: from common clock binding: handle to dp clock.
	of memory mapped region.
- clock-names: from common clock binding:
	Required elements: "clk_edp"
			"clk_edp_24m"
			"clk_edp_24m_parent"
			"pclk_edp"
- resets: Must contain an entry for each entry in reset-names.
	See ../reset/reset.txt for details.
- reset-names: Must include the name "edp"

- rockchip,panel: required a simple panel node as described by
	Documentation/devicetree/bindings/panel/simple-panel.txt
Example:
	edp: edp@ff970000 {
		compatible = "rockchip,rk3288-edp";
		reg = <0xff970000 0x4000>;
		interrupts = <GIC_SPI 98 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
		clocks = <&cru SCLK_EDP>, <&cru SCLK_EDP_24M>, <&cru PCLK_EDP_CTRL>, <&xin24m>;
		clock-names = "clk_edp", "clk_edp_24m", "pclk_edp", "clk_edp_24m_parent";
		rockchip,grf = <&grf>;
		resets = <&cru 111>;
		reset-names = "edp";
		rockchip,panel = <&panel>;
	};
