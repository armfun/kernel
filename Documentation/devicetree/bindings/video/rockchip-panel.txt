Rockchip LCD Display interface
================================
Required properties:
-compatible: "rockchip,rockchip-panel";

- rockchip,output-face: lcdc display mode value should set as following
		"r8g8b8": 24bit display port, R8 G8 B8
		"r6g6b6": 18bit display port, R6 G6 B6
		"r5g6b5": 16bit display port, R5 G6 B5


Optional properties:
- display-timings: timings for the connected panel as described by
	Documentation/devicetree/bindings/video/display-timing.txt
Optional properties:
- rockchip,power-gpios: gpio to power on or off the LCD (as many as needed)
- lcdc-vcc18: Defined if power supply of lcd controller is 1.8v,
		Not defined if power supply of lcd controller is 3.3v.
- output-dither: support dithering the output color.
- color-swap-rb: swap R and B color per pixel.
- color-swap-rg: swap R and G color per pixel.
- color-swap-bg: swap B and G color per pixel.

Example:
	panel {
		compatible = "rockchip,rockchip-panel";
		rockchip,output-face = "r6g6b6"

		enable-gpios = <&gpio7 3 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>
		output-dither;

		display-timings {
			native-mode = <&timing_disp0>;

			timing_disp0: 1280x800 {
				clock-frequency = <71000000>;
				hactive = <1280>;
				vactive = <800>;
				hback-porch = <100>;
				hfront-porch = <18>;
				vback-porch = <8>;
				vfront-porch = <6>;
				hsync-len = <10>;
				vsync-len = <2>;
				hsync-active = <0>;
				vsync-active = <0>;
				de-active = <0>;
				pixelclk-active = <0>;
			};
		};

	};

Rockchip RK3288 LVDS interface
================================
Required properties:
-compatible: "rockchip,rk3288-lvds";

- reg: physical base address of the controller and length

- clocks: from common clock binding: handle to dp clock.
	of memory mapped region.
- clock-names: from common clock binding: Shall be "pclk_lvds".
	pclk_lvds: for power domain, if it disable soc will power down

- rockchip,grf: this soc should set GRF regs, so need get grf here.
- rockchip,data-mapping: should be "vesa" or "jeida"
	This describes how the color bits are laid out in the
	serialized LVDS signal.

- rockchip,data-width: should be <18> or <24>

- rockchip,display: a display node as described by
	Documentation/devicetree/bindings/video/rockchip-display.txt

- rockchip,panel: required a panel node
Example:
SOC specific portion:
	lvds: lvds@ff96c000 {
		compatible = "rockchip,rk3288-lvds";
		reg = <0xff96c000 0x4000>;
		clocks = <&cru PCLK_LVDS_PHY>;
		clock-names = "pclk_lvds";

		rockchip,grf = <&grf>;
		rockchip,data-mapping = "jeida";
		rockchip,data-width = <24>;
		rockchip,panel = <&panel>
	};
