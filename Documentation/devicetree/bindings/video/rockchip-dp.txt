The Rockchip display port interface should be configured based on
the type of panel connected to it.

For the Panel initialization, we read data from dp-controller node.
Required properties for dp:
-compatible: value should be one of the following
		"rockchip,rk32xx-lvds";
		"rockchip,rk32xx-edp";
		"rockchip,rk3288-hdmi";

- rockchip,grf: this soc should set GRF regs, so need get grf here.

- reg: physical base address of the controller and length

- clocks: from common clock binding: handle to dp clock.
		of memory mapped region.
- clock-names: from common clock binding: Shall be "pclk_lvds".
		pclk_lvds: for power domain, if it disable soc will power down

Example:
SOC specific portion:
	lvds: lvds@ff96c000 {
		compatible = "rockchip,rk32-lvds";
		rockchip,grf = <&grf>;
		reg = <0xff96c000 0x4000>;
		clocks = <&cru PCLK_LVDS_PHY>;
		clock-names = "pclk_lvds";
	};
