Device-Tree bindings for Rockchip SoC display controller (LCDC)

LCDC (LCD Controller) is the Display Controller for the Rockchip
series of SoCs which transfers the image data from a video memory
buffer to an external LCD interface.

Required properties:
- compatible: value should be one of the following
		"rockchip,rk3066-lcdc";
		"rockchip,rk3188-lcdc";
		"rockchip,rk3288-lcdc";

- interrupts: should contain a list of all LCDC IP block interrupts in the
		 order: VSYNC, LCD_SYSTEM. The interrupt specifier
		 format depends on the interrupt controller used.

- clocks: must include clock specifiers corresponding to entries in the
         clock-names property.

- clock-names:  Must contain
		aclk_lcdc: for ddr buffer transfer.
		hclk_lcdc: for ahb bus to R/W the phy regs.
		dclk_lcdc: pixel clock.

- rockchip,prop: select which display interface attach lcdc
		0: attach the lcd interface, such as lvds,edp,etc.
		1: attach the hdmi interface.

- rockchip,pwr18: lcdc support VCC 3.3V or 1.8V
		0: 3.3V mode
		1: 1.8V mode

- rockchip,type: select the display interface type, as the following
		0: there is no display interface.
		1: RGB screen
		2: LVDS screen
		3~5: Reserved
		6: HDMI screen
		7: MIPI screen
		8: DUAL_MIPI screen
		9: EDP screen

- rockchip,face: select the lcdc display mode. value should set as following
		0x0: 24bit display port, R8 G8 B8
		0x1: 18bit display port, R6 G6 B6
		0x2: 16bit display port, R5 G6 B5
		0x21: 18bit display port, R6 G6 B6, support dither
		0x22: 16bit display port, R5 G6 B5, support dither

- rockchip,lvds-format: if display interface is LVDS, set the lvds_format.
		0: lvds format is 24bit, R6-R7, G6-G7, B6-B7 at channel 3
		1: lvds format is 24bit, R0-R1, G0-G1, B0-B1 at channel 3
		2: lvds format is 24bit, R0-R1, G0-G1, B0-B1 at channel 3
			but channel 3 data is zero
		3: lvds format is 18bit, it have no channel 3

- rockchip,color-swap: if need color swap,set flags as the following
		0x1: swap R and B color
		0x2: swap R and G color
		0x4: swap B and G color
