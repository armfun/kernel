Device-Tree bindings for Rockchip SoC display controller (LCDC)

LCDC (LCD Controller) is the Display Controller for the Rockchip
series of SoCs which transfers the image data from a video memory
buffer to an external LCD interface.

Required properties:
- compatible: value should be one of the following
		"rockchip,rk3066-lcdc";
		"rockchip,rk3188-lcdc";
		"rockchip,rk3288-lcdc";

- interrupts: should contain a list of all LCDC IP block interrupts in the
		 order: VSYNC, LCD_SYSTEM. The interrupt specifier
		 format depends on the interrupt controller used.

- clocks: must include clock specifiers corresponding to entries in the
		clock-names property.

- clock-names: Must contain
		aclk_lcdc: for ddr buffer transfer.
		hclk_lcdc: for ahb bus to R/W the phy regs.
		dclk_lcdc: pixel clock.

Example:
SoC specific DT entry:
	lcdc1: lcdc@ff940000 {
		compatible = "rockchip,rk3288-lcdc";
		reg = <0xff940000 0x10000>;
		interrupts = <GIC_SPI 16 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
		clocks = <&cru ACLK_LCDC1>, <&cru DCLK_LCDC1>, <&cru HCLK_LCDC1>;
		clock-names = "aclk_lcdc", "dclk_lcdc", "hclk_lcdc";
	};
