* Rockchip Power Domains

Rockchip processors include support for multiple power domains which can be power
up/down by software based on different application scenes to save power.

Required properties for power domain controller:
- compatible: should be one of the following.
    * rockchip,rk3288-power-domain - for rk3288 type power domain.
- #rockchip,power-domain-cells: Number of cells in a power-domain specifier.
				should be 1.
- rockchip,pmu: phandle referencing a syscon providing the pmu registers

Required properties for power domain sub nodes:
- clocks: phandles to clocks which need to be enalbed when power domain swithes state.
- rockchip,pd-id: index of the power domain, should use macro in
                  include/dt-bindings/domain/rockchip.h

Example:

	power: power-domain {
	       compatible = "rockchip,rk3288-power-domain";
	       #rockchip,power-domain-cells = <1>;
	       rockchip,pmu = <&pmu>;

	       pd_gpu {
	               clocks = <&cru ACLK_GPU>;
	               rockchip,pd-id = <RK3288_PD_GPU>;
	       };
	};

Node of a device using power domains must have a rockchip,power-domain property,
containing a phandle to the power device node and an index specifying which power
domain to use. The index should use macro in include/dt-bindings/domain/rockchip.h

Example of the node using power domain:

	node {
		/* ... */
		rockchip,power-domain = <&power RK3288_PD_GPU>;
		/* ... */
	};
